## The Uncommons
Because the commons, i.e., public spaces such as coffee shops and libraries, are often not optimal venues for autistic people, we are opening _The Uncommons_: professional, autism-friendly co-working spaces. We have two locations that have been offered to us to use. We have a fantastic autistic person ready to organize and run this as soon as we can fund their salary.

## Autism Clubhouse
While not an actual clubhouse yet, the _Autism Clubhouse_ is currently two autism-friendly, program-free, and agenda-free drop-in public spaces. Craft or work in parallel play, chat, stim, whatever. We have two locations and will soon open with at least 15 hrs/week.

## Autism Networking Conference
We have been disheartened to find that while many excellent (and a few not-so-excellent) organizations in Oregon serve autistic adults in one way or another, few know very much about any of the others. We are coordinating with the [Oregon Commission on Autism Spectrum Disorder](https://www.orcommissionasd.org/) (OCASD) to host a state-wide conference where these organizations can meet and learn about each other.

## Knowledge Gathering
We are coordinating with the [Oregon Commission on Autism Spectrum Disorder](https://www.orcommissionasd.org/) (OCASD) to conduct surveys to learn about the invisible community of autistic adults. Some topics of particular interest are:

- Experiences getting an evaluation
- Services we would like but can't get and other unmet needs
- Stories of coming out as autistic to friends, family, and co-workers

## Facilitate and Support Community Efforts
We will do what we can to help other community efforts to support autistic people, particularly with information, writing, data analysis, and networking. 

Some things the autistic community would love to see happen are:
- **Showcasing Oregon's autistic creators.** Art, Poetry, Video, Music, Crafts, etc.
- **Peer-support.** We believe that the peer-support model, which is currently getting a lot of funding and attention, is particularly well suited for the autistic - community. We want to help get peer-support projects off the ground.
- **Suicide prevention.** Suicide is a painful scourge on the autistic community. Yet, there is little research or practice for adjusting response techniques to autistic people. We want to support efforts to address this.
