## Why we need your help?
AAGU launched in 2025 with a small grant. We have several critical projects about to launch, but the current economic and political climate has made it harder than ever for grassroots organizations like ours to survive.

Funding for disability services, diversity initiatives, and foundational research is being slashed nationwide—putting immense pressure on private foundations and severely limiting the support available to Autistic-led efforts like ours.

**_Without individual donations, we simply won’t be able to continue this work._**

Your support helps us keep moving forward. Autism All Grown Up operates under fiscal sponsorship by [Cascade Pacific RC&D](https://cascadepacific.org/), 501(c)(3) nonprofit. All donations are tax-deductible.
