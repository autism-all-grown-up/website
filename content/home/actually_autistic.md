## Savants are rare. Capable autistic people are not.
Advocacy is working to change our general view of neurodiversity and how we handle it in society, including how to adjust research priorities for autism. This work moves slowly. In the meantime, millions of autistic adults are trying to redefine and reclaim their identities and hopefully overcome some of their past struggles.

We want to help our autistic community NOW and have found ways to do so without waiting for the slow machinery of political, scientific, industrial, and cultural change. Our critical insight is that the adult autistic community is already primed with untapped resources in the form of talented, creative, and caring people who have the exact skills needed.

Past missteps in identifying and characterizing autism have led to numerous misunderstandings and myths. Counter to these, the vast majority of autistic people:

- Are cognitively or intellectually capable
- Are socially motivated and want relationships and community
- Are in much greater need of _acceptance and understanding_ than accommodation
- Are in the best position to support other autistic people, including those who may be profoundly impacted by autism, associated trauma or conditions endemic to autistic genotypes.

## By us and for us
The growth in leadership by autistic voices in the public arena and academia has firmly established that autistics and other neurodivergent people comprise a distinct group rather than merely a broken form of normal.

While we owe a massive debt to the tireless advocacy that parents and other allies have performed over the generations, ultimately, no one understands autistic people like other autistic people. Fact.

AAGU was started by autistic people and we thoroughly enjoy working together. By sourcing talent from within the autistic community, we can take one small step towards creating a welcoming environment for other autistic people.
