Although the number of "Quality of Life" studies has increased in recent years, it still receives a tiny 
amount of actual funding dollars compared to Biology-oriented studies looking for causes, cures, and 
treatments. The data for this chart comes from the [autism research database](https://iacc.hhs.gov/funding/data/) 
provided by the [Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee](https://iacc.hhs.gov/) (IACC), a United States federal 
advisory panel within the [Department of Health and Human Services](https://www.hhs.gov/) (HHS). It coordinates 
all efforts within HHS concerning autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We bundled the IACC objectives into a smaller 
number of categories. We put any program with an objective related to "Biology", "Causes", "Genetic or Environmental 
Effects", or "Risk factors" into "Biology". We put any program with an objective related to "Lifespan", "Lifespan 
issues", "Services", or "Services and Supports" into "Quality of Life".
