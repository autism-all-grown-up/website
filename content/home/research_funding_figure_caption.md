## Research to prevent or cure autism dominates research funding at the cost of improving quality of life
Although the number of "Quality of Life" studies has increased in recent years, it still receives a tiny amount of actual funding dollars compared to Biology-oriented studies looking for causes, cures, and treatments. The data for this chart comes from the [autism research database](https://iacc.hhs.gov/funding/data/) provided by the [Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee](https://iacc.hhs.gov/) (IACC), a United States federal advisory panel within the [Department of Health and Human Services](https://www.hhs.gov/) (HHS). It coordinates all efforts within HHS concerning autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We bundled the IACC objectives into a smaller number of categories. We put any program with an objective related to "Biology", "Causes", "Genetic or Environmental 
Effects", or "Risk factors" into "Biology". We put any program with an objective related to "Lifespan", "Lifespan issues", "Services", or "Services and Supports" into "Quality of Life".
