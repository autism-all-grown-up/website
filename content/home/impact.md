## Attainable Objectives  
AAGU believes it can help nurture organic changes by facilitating small steps to empower autistic adults to live rich, 
independent lives by facilitating innovation and supporting existing programs through networking, collaboration, and education.

### Community
- Build partnerships with local organizations by networking and creating alliances. 
- Establish _The Uncommons_: Physical meeting and coworking spaces where autistic adults can work and socialize unmasked.

### Communication
- Improve communication channels to enhance service delivery.
- Facilitate connections and collaboration within the adult autistic community.

### Information
- Identify the unmet needs of autistic adults and report on the causes.
- Provide accurate, accessible content for and about autism and the adult autistic community.
- Create comprehensive and accessible guides on navigating healthcare, employment, and social services.
- Improve online resources for autistic adults and provide consulting services to others to do the same.
- Participate in data analysis and research to inform policy and advocacy efforts.
- Unlike most autism-related websites, _we will allocate a significant portion of our budget to continuously 
  reviewing and updating this information as it evolves_.
