## Unmet needs
Only a fraction of autistic adults in Oregon receive social services. Not all of us need them, but a huge gap remains. Access to services and information remains a persistent problem.

## Mission
The mission of Autism All Grown Up (AAGU) is to empower autistic adults in Oregon by serving as a nexus that provides accessible information resources that are tailored to our unique needs. By bridging gaps in the existing infrastructure, we connect and interconnect the adult autistic community and our supporters, facilitate information exchange, and promote collaboration. This ensures that autistic individuals can access the support and opportunities we need to thrive, enhancing our well-being and independence throughout the state.

## What We Do
Working _within_ the autistic community, we listen to autistic voices to identify and document systemic challenges. We then 
perform root cause analysis, create or propose solutions, and publish the results publicly.

- Build community through outreach and autism-friendly physical spaces.
- Identify unmet needs in the community.
- Find ways to meet those needs.
- Spread the information.
