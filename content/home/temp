# Many autistic adults in Oregon are invisible, marginalized, and struggling. We can fix this.

## Mission
The mission of Autism All Grown Up (AAGU) is to empower autistic adults in Oregon by serving as a nexus that provides 
accessible information, resources, and services tailored to their unique needs. By bridging gaps in the existing 
infrastructure, we connect and interconnect the adult autistic community and our supporters, facilitate information 
exchange, and promote collaboration. This ensures that autistic individuals can access the support and opportunities 
we need to thrive, enhancing our well-being and independence throughout the state.


## What We Do
- Build community through outreach and autism-friendly physical spaces.
- Identify unmet needs in the community.
- Find ways to meet those needs.

Working from within the community, we listen to autistic voices to identify and document systemic challenges. We then 
perform root cause analysis, create or propose solutions, and publish the results for the public. Our work helps autistic 
adults in Oregon find and access the services and resources they need, helps others better understand their needs, and creates 
new resources as needed.


# Autism is Lifelong. Support and Research Haven’t Been. We are just starting to learn what successful adulthood looks like for autistic people.

## Lost Generations
So little research has acknowledged the lives of adults with autism that we are just starting to learn what successful 
adult development looks like. Until recently, almost all attention to autism has been focused on children, early 
intervention, and treatment. Late-identified and never-identified autistic adults face unique challenges with respect 
to aging, and most of these "lost generations" have not yet even been identified, accounted for, or documented.


## Invisible Majority
Autistic adults represent the vast majority of autistic people but have a tiny fraction of the acknowledgment and 
support. Because autistic is how you are born, there are, in fact, way more autistic adults than children. Many 
experts believe that massive numbers of adults who have been wondering their entire lives why they have felt out of 
place and faced so many challenges in life despite their abilities are probably undiagnosed autistic adults. Sadly, 
experts also think many of these people have ended up on the dark sidelines of society: the ranks of the unemployed, 
homeless, in the penal system, in the foster system, struggling with addiction, and lost to suicide.


# Autistic adults face a multitude of significant and endemic challenges.

## A Partial List
- Work/Life: Landing and keeping a job is often an uphill battle. Many find themselves unemployed or in roles that 
  don't tap their potential. Hiring processes and workplace environments frequently clash with autistic needs, creating 
  frustrating barriers.
- Health care hurdles: Medical settings can be overwhelming sensory minefields. Many doctors struggle to connect with 
  autistic patients, leading to misunderstandings and subpar care. Getting diagnosed as an adult? It's a long, winding road 
  that can delay access to crucial support.
- Social challenges: Building and maintaining relationships is like navigating a maze without a map. Isolation is common, 
  especially during big life transitions like starting a career or living independently. The â€œservices cliffâ€ at high 
  school graduation is a prime example.
- Mental health struggles: Anxiety, depression, and thoughts of suicide are all too common. Many mental health services miss 
  the mark, leaving autistic adults feeling misunderstood and unsupported.
- Learning and working: Some face learning difficulties that ripple into job prospects. Sensory sensitivities, anxiety, and 
  challenges with independent work can create roadblocks to employment.

These issues often snowball, making life tougher across the board. 


## Tap into the Nexus

AAGU believes it can help nurture organic changes by facilitating small steps to empower autistic adults to live rich, 
independent lives by supporting existing programs through networking, collaboration, and education.

- Create autism-friendly workspaces
- Train healthcare providers to really get it
- Build stronger peer-support social support networks
- Promote mental health approaches that actually click with autistic minds
- Tailor work and education to play to autistic strengths


# The autistic community has the talent and ability to create solutions NOW. “Actually Autistic” adults are not what you see on TV.

## Savants are rare. Capable autistic people are not.
Advocacy is working to change our general view of neurodiversity and how we handle it in society, including how to adjust 
research priorities for autism. This work moves slowly. In the meantime, millions of autistic adults are trying to redefine 
and reclaim their identities and hopefully overcome some of their past struggles.

We want to help our autistic community NOW and have found ways to do so without waiting for the slow machinery of political, 
scientific, industrial, and cultural change. Our key insight is that the adult autistic community is already primed with 
untapped resources in the form of talented, creative, and caring people who have the exact skills needed.

Past missteps in identifying and characterizing autism have led to numerous misunderstandings and myths. Counter to these, the 
vast majority of autistic people:

- Are cognitively or intellectually capable
- Are socially motivated and want relationships and community
- Are in much greater need of acceptance and understanding vs accommodation
- Are in the best position to support other autistic people, including those who may be profoundly impacted by autism, associated 
trauma, or conditions endemic to autistic genotypes.


## By us and for us
The growth in leadership by autistic voices in the public arena and academia has firmly established that autistics and other 
neurodivergent people comprise a distinct group rather than merely a broken form of normal.

While we owe a huge debt to the tireless advocacy that parents and other allies have performed over the generations, ultimately, 
no one understands autistic people like other autistic people. Fact.

AAGU was started by autistic people and we thoroughly enjoy working together. By sourcing talent from within the autistic community, 
we can take one small step towards creating a welcoming environment for other autistic people.


# Working from within the autistic community, we will focus on four attainable objectives that will directly and immediately improve the lives of Oregon's autistic adults.

## Attainable Objectives
- Facilitate connections and collaboration within the adult autistic community.
- Identify the unmet needs of autistic adults and report on the causes.
- Provide accurate, accessible content for and about autism and the adult autistic community.
- Unlike most autism-related websites, _we will allocate a significant portion of our budget to continuously reviewing and updating 
  this information as it evolves._


## Immediate Impact

We can make an immediate impact by activating and empowering the autistic community in Oregon.

- Build partnerships with local organizations by networking and creating alliances.
- Improve communication channels to enhance service delivery and information resources by networking and building alliances.
- Establish _The Uncommons_: Physical meeting and coworking spaces where autistic adults can work and socialize unmasked.
- Create comprehensive and accessible guides on navigating healthcare, employment, and social services.
- Improve online resources for autistic adults and provide consulting services to others to do the same.

- Participate in data analysis and research to inform policy and advocacy efforts.
