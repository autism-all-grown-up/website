## Lost Generations
So little research has acknowledged the lives of adults with autism that we are just starting to learn what successful 
adult development looks like. Until recently, almost all attention to autism has been focused on children, early 
intervention, and treatment. Late-identified and never-identified autistic adults face unique challenges with respect 
to aging, and most of these "lost generations" have not yet even been identified, accounted for, or documented.

## Invisible Majority
Autistic adults represent the vast majority of autistic people but have a tiny fraction of the acknowledgment and 
support. Because autistic is how we are born, there are, in fact, way more autistic adults than children. Many 
experts believe that massive numbers of adults who have been wondering their entire lives why they have felt out of 
place and faced so many challenges in life despite their abilities are probably undiagnosed autistic adults. Sadly, 
experts also think many of these people have ended up on the dark sidelines of society: the ranks of the unemployed, 
homeless, in the penal system, in the foster system, struggling with addiction, or lost to suicide.
