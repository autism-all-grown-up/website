## Dr. Bones McCoy trying to save Chancellor Gorkon of the Klingon High Council in _The Undiscovered Country_

Fans have found it pretty ridiculous that McCoy would know nothing about Klingon
anatomy and have no way to find out. We think it's pretty ridiculous how little
doctors know about autism, all the different ways it affects people's lives, and
how to properly talk to and care for autistic people.
