## Only a fraction of autistic adults in Oregon receive I/DD services

The Oregon Department of Disability Services (ODDS) reported that the agency served 22,984 adults with an intellectual or developmental disability in 2023. A 2021-2022 survey by ODDS and along with the [National Core Indicators](https://idd.nationalcoreindicators.org/") (NCI) project showed that 6,435 (28%) of Oregon adults receiving I/DD services had an Autism diagnosis. The US Census estimates that in 2022, there were roughly 3,404,221 adults (18+) in Oregon. A CDC study (2020) estimated that in 2017, 2.28% (95% CI [1.83, 2.8]) of Oregon adults were diagnosed as autistic in numbers: 77,616 (95% CI [62,297, 95,318]).
